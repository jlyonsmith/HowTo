# macOS Developer System Setup

These instructions assume a clean installation of macOS Big Sur or Monterey and that you are logged on as an administrator user, i.e. you can run `sudo`.

## Security

Add an additional fingerprint in **System Preferences -> TouchID**

Enable watch unlock in **System Preferences -> Security & Privacy** if you have a watch!

## Dock

Turn on "Automatically hide and show the Dock" in **System Preferences -> Dock & Menu Bar**

## Install Homebrew

_NOTE: Be careful!!! There is a Trojan Horse site parked at `http://homebrew.sh` that looks like the Homebrew site but which actually attempts to install malware._

Go to [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), copy the line and run it:

![homebrew](images/homebrew.png)

Add `brew` to the path with `export PATH=$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin`. Run `brew doctor` and _fix all the problems that it tells you about_.

> You *do not need to or want* to be `sudo` when you install Homebrew. If you have installed Homebrew with `sudo`, uninstall it and re-install as yourself.

## SSH

Copy your SSH key from your previous machine backup or  generate a new one with a passphrase:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
```

Then add the private key to your local `ssh-agent` with:

```sh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/<your-alias>
```
