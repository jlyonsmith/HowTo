# Flutter Project Setup

## Customize Lints

Add to  `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
  rules:
    prefer_relative_imports: true
    prefer_single_quotes: true
    avoid_print: false
```

## Icons

Use [Icons_Launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/icons_launcher).  Follow the instructions on the pub.dev page.

Create a `dev_assets/` folder. Put an `appicon.png` there.  Add this to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter_icons:
  android: true
  ios: true
  image_path: "dev_assets/icon/appicon.png"
  adaptive_icon_background: "#191919"
  adaptive_icon_foreground: "dev_assets/appicon-adaptive.png"
```

Picking your own background/foreground colors/images.

Run `flutter pub run icons_launcher:main`.

## Splash Screen

Android icon and splash assets are under `android/app/src/main/res/`.

<item>
  <bitmap android:gravity="center" android:src="@drawable/splash_icon" />
</item>
```
