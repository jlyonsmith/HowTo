# How to Use One Device for Multiple Apple Accounts

In macOS, create a new user account in System Preferences. The name and other information you use here does not matter. Make sure you have easy access to the Apple account password information when you log into the other account, i.e. through LastPass.

Logout and login to the other account. You will have to go through all the new user setup guff. Just skip everything, including setting up the iCloud account. We'll do that in a minute.

Once logged in, go to System Preferences > iCloud and sign in with the Apple ID that you are setting up 2FA for.

Once you've signed in, you'll see a message about setting up 2FA for the account. Click the button to start the process.

First you'll enter your email and password. Grab your password from LastPass or wherever. You may have to answer a couple of your secret questions. You remember the answers, right?

Enter your phone number to get a text message with a 6 digit code. Enter it. Uncheck the boxes for iCloud and Find My Mac on the next screen.

You'll have to enter your iCloud password again. Then the macOS password for then new account. Eventually, you'll be done. Yay!

Now, _before you log out of this account_, go to your phone and find Settings > Passwords & Accounts. Add a new account for iCloud for the Apple ID. You will get a message on your Mac with a 6 digit code. Back on the phone enter it, then turn off email, calendar, notes and click Done.

Now you can log out, go back to your main account and delete the temporary account.

Phew!
