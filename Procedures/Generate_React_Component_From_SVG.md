# Generate a React Component from SVG

Go to [SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/) and follow the instructions to generate a `.js` file from an SVG file.  This allows you to change the size and colors manually.

Or, if the SVG is already the right size, just import the `.svg` like so:

```js
import { ReactComponent as GoogleLogo } from "../assets/images/googlelogo.svg"
```
