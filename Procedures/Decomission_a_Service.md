# Decomissioning Services

First task is to make sure that all source is committed and the project is left in a good state.  Don't leave any partially finished commits around or you will be frustrated if you decide to restart the project.

To decomission an Ubuntu service:

1. As `sudo -s`...
1. Remove `nginx` configuration by moving the `xxx.conf` file under `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` to `./saved` and issuing `nginx -s reload`
1. Stop service with `service xxx stop`
1. Remove `xxx.conf` file from `/etc/init/` (it should be saved in the project repo)
1. Delete `~/bin/` scripts (again, should be in the repo)
1. Delete sources from `/lib/xxx` (generated by the build)
1. Remove Route53 DNS names (if necessary)
1. Stop auto-renew on domain names (if necessary)
