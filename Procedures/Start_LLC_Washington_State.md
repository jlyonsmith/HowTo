# How To Start an LLC in Washington State

## Introduction

Setting up an LLC in Washington State is, like many things, a sequence of simple steps that added together take a while to complete and must be done in the right order.  Make sure you have the following available:

- A company name picked out that is not already registered. You can [search existing business licenses online](https://secure.dor.wa.gov/gteunauth/_/#1)
- You'll need a secure Google Drive or other place to safely store all the electronic documents
- Have somewhere to safely store paper documents too - you _will_ need to find them again one day!
- There's a lot of online accounts you need to set up.  If you do not have a password manager then I suggest you set up [BitWarden](https://go.bitwarden.com) right now.
- A credit card.  It costs a couple of hundred dollars to set up the company and pay all the filing fees.  You'll have to pay again each year.
- You are signing up to file quarterly revenue returns and a yearly statement.  Mark your calendar with the dates. You'll get reminders from the Department of Revenue and Secretary of State but they won't be friendly.
- An operating agreement (see below)
- Full details of who the partners are, including SSN's, addresses, emails, phone numbers, etc..

Here are the full process with links to the relevant sites.
## Step-by-Step

Go to the Washington State [Corporations & Charities Filing System (C&CFS)](https://ccfs.sos.wa.gov/#/) site.  Create an account if you don't already have one (you only need one account to manage multiple companies.)

> Once you have a name, it's a good idea to grab an Internet domain name that matches it as closely as possible, and set up the DNS and email for the domain.  You'll need it to receive emails from the government agencies.

Log in to the dashboard and select **Create or Register a Business** on the left.  Follow the online process to create a new LLC. You and your business partners will be the *executors* of the company.  The cost as of 11/1/2020 is $200.  You need to pick a name that has `LLC` at the and.  The site will let you know if the name you have chosen is already taken.  This will give you a UBI number which is also the number you need to get a business license for state taxes.

Create your Operating Agreement. [LawDepot.com](https://www.lawdepot.com) has a good wizard for doing this and only charges around $39 (in 2023).  Member owned is the normal way of forming an LLC and the simplest for taxes.  Just split all the profits evenly among the partners, and declare the revenue and expenses when you file your personal taxes each year.  It's might be time to get a CPA to file your taxes and kiss TurboTax good-bye.  If you insist on continuing to plough through the 9800+ pages of the US federal tax code yourself, then you'll be purchasing the Small Business Edition of TurboTax each year from now on.

File an initial report on the [C&CFS](https://ccfs.sos.wa.gov/#/) site within 120 days of formation.  You also need to file an annual report here too.

Apply for your [Federal EIN number](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online).  You need this number to pay federal taxes for the company or its employees.

Purchase a [WA state business license](https://secure.dor.wa.gov/atlaseservices/wtp/_/#11).  More information on the [WA State Department of Revenue](https://dor.wa.gov/open-business/apply-business-license) site.  You'll get a letter with a code on it.  Go to [WA Department of Revenue (DOR)](https://dor.wa.gov/), register an account if you don't already have one and then click on "Access your account using a letter ID" to attach the corporation using the code.

File quarterly tax returns at the [WA Department of Revenue](https://dor.wa.gov/taxes-rates/business-occupation-tax) and pay B&O tax if you necessary. They'll send you a reminder.

Order a [Dun & Bradstreet DUNS number](https://www.dnb.com/duns-number/get-a-duns.html) if you want to register as an Apple Developer for app store development.  That's just about the only thing I have used it for.

Note, at the end of all this you will end up with *two* online accounts with two separate passwords:

1. A [Department of Revenue (DOR)](https://secure.dor.wa.gov) account
2. A [Secretary of State (SOS)](https://ccfs.sos.wa.gov/#/) account

The first is for paying your taxes. The second is for managing your business registration.

Note that the a WA company will be administratively closed after two years if you don't make any money.  File that you made $1 if you need too in order to avoid that and pay the few pennies in tax yourself (yes, it's perfectly legal to overpay your taxes).
