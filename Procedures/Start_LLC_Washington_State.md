# How To Start an LLC in Washington State

## Introduction

Setting up an LLC in Washington State is, like many things, a sequence of simple steps that added together take a while to complete and must be done in the right order.  Make sure you have the following available:

- A company name picked out that is not already registered. You can [search existing business licenses online](https://secure.dor.wa.gov/gteunauth/_/#1)
- You'll need a secure Google Drive or other place to safely store all the electronic documents
- Have somewhere to safely store paper documents too - you _will_ need to find them again one day!
- There's a lot of online accounts you need to set up.  If you do not have a password manager then I suggest you set up [BitWarden](https://go.bitwarden.com) right now.
- A credit card.  It costs a couple of hundred dollars to set up the company and pay all the filing fees.  You'll have to pay again each year.
- You are signing up to file quarterly revenue returns and a yearly statement.  Mark you calendar with the dates. You'll get reminders from the Dept of Revenue and Secretary of State but they won't be friendly.
- An operating agreement (see below)
- Full details of who the partners are, including SSN's, addresses, emails, phone numbers, etc..

## Step-by-Step

Go to the Washington State [Corporations & Charities Filing System](https://ccfs.sos.wa.gov/#/) site.  Create an account if you don't already have one (you only need one account to manage multiple companies.)

Log in to the dashboard and select **Create or Register a Business** on the left.  Follow the online process to create a new LLC. You and your business partners will be the _executors_.  The cost as of 11/1/2020 is $200.  You need to pick a name that has `, LLC` at the and.  The site will let you know if the name you have chosen is already taken.  This will give you a UBI number which is also the number you need to get a business license for state taxes.

Create your Operating Agreement. [LawDepot.com](https://www.lawdepot.com) has a good wizard for doing this and only charges around $39.  Member owned is the normal way of forming an LLC and the simplest for taxes.  Split all profits evenly among the partners, and declare the revenue and expenses when you file your personal taxes each year.  You'll need to purchase the Business Edition of TurboTax each year from now on.

File an initial report on the [C&CFS](https://ccfs.sos.wa.gov/#/) site within 120 days of formation.  You also need to file an annual report here.

Apply for your [Federal EIN number](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online).  You need this number to pay federal taxes for the company or its employees.

Purchase a [WA state business license](https://secure.dor.wa.gov/atlaseservices/wtp/_/#11).  More information on the [WA State Department of Revenue](https://dor.wa.gov/open-business/apply-business-license) site.  You'll get a letter with a code on it.  Go to [WA Department of Revenue (DOR)](https://dor.wa.gov/), register an account if you don't already have one and then click on "Access your account using a letter ID" to attach the corporation using the code.

File quarterly tax returns at the [WA Department of Revenue](https://dor.wa.gov/taxes-rates/business-occupation-tax) and pay B&O tax if you necessary.  They'll send you a reminder.

Order a [Dun & Bradstreet DUNS number](https://www.dnb.com/duns-number/get-a-duns.html) if you want to register as an Apple Developer.

Note, you will end up with two online accounts:

1. A [Department of Revenue (DOR)](https://secure.dor.wa.gov) account
2. A [Secretary of State (SOS)](https://ccfs.sos.wa.gov/#/) account
